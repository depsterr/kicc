k / kicc - kiss implemented in POSIX C (WIP)
============================================

A (work in progress) port of the kiss package manager to POSIX C.

Make targets
------------

all / default: make binary

install: install binary

clean: clean object files

docs: generate "docs" (docs.txt) from comments in headers

What works?
-----------

[x] List packages (kiss l)
[x] Search packages (kiss s)
[x] Listing extentions (kiss)
[x] Running extentions (kiss <extention>)

  What doesn't work?
  ------------------

  [x] Everything else

What do the scripts do?
-----------------------

make_docs.sh is what make uses to make docs.txt. Since
it outputs to stdout you can pipe into a pager.

lookup.sh searches the docs for substrings and then
prints the comment for the matching items.

Contributing
------------

Feel free to contribute, just beware that all multiline comments that
start and end on different lines in headers get used by the docs script.

Therefore, when commenting in headers, format comments for functions
and global variables like this:

/*
    comment text wow descriptive, helpfull yet
    somewhat short explenation of function.
 */
foo* bar(void);

Format other comments like this

/* comment */
/* foo bar */

  Style Guide
  -----------
 
  Functions that are error checking versions / wrappers for existing
    ones are prefixed with x
 
  The function definition is a single row
 
  char** argv, not char **argv (pointers as part of the datatype, not
    variable)
 
  Put a space before the perenthasis after if, while and for BUT NOT
    in function calls / definitions
 
  '{' goes on the same line
 
  Indentation is 4 spaces (set ts=4 sw=4 expandtab)
 
  multiple_word_vars_and_functions_use_underscore
